2. **Modern web standards** - demonstrates cutting-edge CSS features
3. **Accessibility focus** - aligns with WCAG 3 guidelines for inclusive design
4. **Visual appeal** - CSS magic provides natural dashboard aesthetics
5. **Educational value** - helps developers learn new CSS and accessibility practices

### Technical Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Core Structure (30 minutes)
- [ ] HTML layout with semantic elements for accessibility
- [ ] Implement new CSS features (Grid, Flexbox, Animations, etc.)

- [ ] Basic WCAG 3 compliance indicators

#### Phase 2: CSS Magic & Accessibility (30 minutes)
- [ ] Add advanced CSS properties and effects
- [ ] Implement WCAG 3 guideline demonstrations
- [ ] Create accessibility toggle features
- [ ] Add feature compatibility checks

#### Phase 3: Polish & Interactivity (30 minutes)
- [ ] Responsive design with modern CSS
- [ ] Smooth transitions and micro-interactions
- [ ] Accessibility testing and improvements
- [ ] Final styling and WCAG 3 compliance validation

### Data Sources
- **CSS Publications:** https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/css/publications/#crd
- **WCAG 3 Guidelines:** https://w3c.github.io/wcag3/guidelines/
- **Interactive Examples:** Static demos and code snippets

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, ES6+
- **CSS Features:** Grid, Flexbox, Custom Properties, Animations, Container Queries
- **JavaScript:** Minimal for interactivity and accessibility toggles
- **Styling:** Modern CSS with fallbacks for compatibility
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 3 compliance, ARIA labels, semantic HTML

### Success Criteria
1. **Functional:** Demonstrates working CSS features
2. **Accessible:** Meets WCAG 3 guidelines
3. **Polished:** Professional appearance with smooth interactions
4. **Complete:** Core CSS magic and accessibility features working
5. **Documented:** Clear README with CSS features and WCAG 3 notes

### Backup Plan
If external resources are slow:
- Use static HTML/CSS examples
- Focus on local CSS implementations
- Include links to W3C resources for reference

### Stretch Goals (if time permits)
- [ ] Advanced CSS features (Houdini, etc.)
- [ ] Automated WCAG 3 compliance checker
- [ ] Export CSS snippets functionality
- [ ] Browser compatibility matrix
- [ ] Dark/light theme with CSS custom properties

## Development Strategy
1. **Start with CSS examples** - set up basic demos first
2. **Build incrementally** - get basic version working, then enhance
3. **Test continuously** - check functionality at each step
4. **Prioritize core features** - ensure main value proposition works
5. **Document as you go** - README and comments for final submission

## Final Deliverables
- GitHub repository with source code
- Live demo (GitHub Pages or similar)
- README with project description and setup instructions
- Screenshot for submission
- 90-second demo prepared for lightning talks
